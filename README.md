# VimConfig
A collection of my growing configuration of Vim

Please note that this configuration is intended for use at Windows environment. There are several folder that you must create to handle the swap / view / backup file vim creates:

* vim_backup
* vim_swap
* vim_undo
* vim_view

I disable the unswap in this config, feel free to play around or giving suggestion.

Do play around with the config! You shall have your own configuration instead of this one. I use Vim mainly for javascript, C#, elixir, and markdown. I write prose a lot, so there's pencil, and the colorscheme is gruvbox, best markdown viewing for me.
